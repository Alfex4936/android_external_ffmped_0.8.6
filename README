Modification and updates
------------------------

The following files were added to ffmpeg source code, so that Google Android NDK r7b can build it:

ffmpeg/libavutil/avconfig.h
ffmpeg/Android.mk
ffmpeg/Android_Build_Common.mk
ffmpeg/Android_Source_Files.mk
ffmpeg/config.h
ffmpeg/version.h
ffmpeg/configure_android.sh

Also some source files are modified with __LGE__ #define statement.
You can search them to check what is added and updated.

Please put the whole source structure into your NDK application (under jni directory) and refer this Android.mk as any NDK application.
After that the following commands will build FFmpeg for Android:

$ ndk-build

Please see the configure_android.sh script that GPL'ed and Non Free code is removed from the build.

This FFmpeg source code is configured to use OpenCORE libraries for AMR-NB decoding/encoding.
